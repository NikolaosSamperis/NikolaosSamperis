# 👋 Hi, I’m Nikolaos Samperis

**MSc Bioinformatics | Molecular Biology | Machine Learning | Multi-omics Integration**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a graduate bioinformatician with a strong academic foundation in molecular biology, complemented by interdisciplinary training in computational data analysis, machine learning, and scalable data infrastructure. My work bridges experimental and computational domains, with a focus on biomedical discovery and translational research.

## 🔬 Research Focus & Technical Interests

- **Multi-omics Data Integration**: Harmonising and analysing high-dimensional multi-omics datasets from diverse clinical and experimental sources.
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: Applying traditional ML and deep neural networks for classification, regression, and biomarker discovery in biomedical data.
- **Computational Biology Pipelines**: Building workflows for the integration, analysis, and interpretation of diverse omics datasets (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics), with emphasis on biological insight and phenotype linkage.
- **Data Infrastructure & Visualisation**: Developing APIs and web platforms for scientific data access, visualisation, and interaction.

## 🧠 Selected Projects

### 🔷 PlaqueMS (Private Repository)
*A secure web platform for multi-cohort atherosclerosis omics analysis (MSc Thesis Project)*  
- Designed and implemented using Django, MySQL, and Neo4j.  
- Integrated multi-modal proteomics and clinical metadata across three independent cohorts.
- Supports phenotype-driven exploration, protein network visualisation, and embedded ML models (SVM, Random Forest, Elastic Net Regression) optimised via a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm.

> **Note:** This repository is currently private due to inclusion of data from an unpublished study and will be made public following its publication (expected in 6–12 months).

### 🧪 [RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline](https://github.com/NikolaosSamperis/Reconstruction-of-RNA-seq-analysis)
*Reconstructed and benchmarked RNA-seq analysis to assess reproducibility and methodological transparency*
- Preprocessed RNA-seq data from SRA, including quality assessment with `FastQC`, alignment using `STAR`, and read quantification with `featureCounts`.
- Performed differential expression and GO/KEGG enrichment analysis in R using Bioconductor packages (e.g. DESeq2, clusterProfiler).  
- Generated visualisations in R, including PCA for batch effect assessment, as well as heatmaps and volcano plots for differential expression.

### 🧠 [CNN–Retinal Disease Classifier](https://github.com/NikolaosSamperis/CNN-RetinalDisease-Pipeline)
*Deep learning-based image classification for glaucoma and cataract detection*  
- Transfer learning using **EfficientNetB0** and **DenseNet-121** with custom classification heads.  
- Data augmentation, focal loss, and validation strategies applied to improve sensitivity.

### 🧬 [Genotype2Phenotype Dashboard](https://github.com/NikolaosSamperis/Genotype2Phenotype)
*Interactive RShiny dashboard for exploring gene–phenotype links in mouse models*  
- MySQL-backed, with UMAP clustering and dimensionality reduction.  
- Robust preprocessing and dynamic filtering features.
